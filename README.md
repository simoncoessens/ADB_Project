# Benchmarking Cloud Databases: Microsoft Azure vs. Google Cloud

## Overview

This project, conducted as part of the Advanced Database course (INFO-H415) at ULB, benchmarks cloud database services from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, focusing on PostgreSQL deployments. The analysis includes setup, execution, and results for performance testing using a business case dataset (Taxi Lecco) and standardized benchmarks (TPROC-C).
